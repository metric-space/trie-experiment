### Goal of the project 

To use a Trie and levenstein distance or maybe some other string metric 
to create a simple dictionary based autocomplete and a small correct-word-suggestion feature web app

### Libraries used

1. Angular 
2. Rails-REST-api
3. Angular Material for the frontend 

### Other fun stuff

1. frontend is completely seperate from the backend
2. frontend is to be served independently and communicates with the backend via restful urls
